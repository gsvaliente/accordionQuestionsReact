# Accordion Question Project

Small app that takes questions through the data.js file. It needs an id, title, and question.

To make it functional and hide each question, state is used. In addition, to just have **one** question open at a time. Another state is used. This one initially is set to null. When a user clicks on the expand, this state is changed to the ID of that question.

More questions can be added through the data.js file.

Information was transferred with the help of props.
